# Js_1

## LIBRARY

This is a simple project using objects and object constructors that I have learnt in the previous lesson.

##### Acknowledgements

localStorage : to keep data in myLibrary stay through page loads

## Tic tac toe

Tic tac toe project using modules and factory function. But 2 modules gameBoard and displayController can present the game well, so no need Player factory function

##### Difficulty

I think this is a hard case for me, and a good chance to learn how to define needed function, make things work, follow the app logic in JS way.
