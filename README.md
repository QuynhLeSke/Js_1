## Library

This is a simple project using objects and object constructors that I have learnt in the previous lesson.

##### Acknowledgements

localStorage : to keep data in myLibrary stay through page loads
storage event : auto load the second page with the same url

## Tic tac toe

Tic tac toe project using modules and factory function.

##### Difficulty
